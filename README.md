Mechanical Documentation Analyzer

Project Overview:

This project is designed to read and process the mechanical documentation of air conditioning (AC) systems.
Its goal is to speed up the process of analyzing materials and understanding construction drawing schematics more efficiently, while reducing the chance of human errors during analysis.

By integrating a frontend PDF upload interface with a backend machine learning model, this tool assists engineers and designers in navigating complex technical documents.

Features:
Drag & Drop / File Upload interface for PDF files
Supports two input types:
Read Notes
Read Specifications
Backend integration with a machine learning model for document analysis
Displays results
Helps avoid misinterpretation of mechanical drawings and specifications

Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML
Backend: Python
Machine Learning: Custom model for document processing (extensible)
